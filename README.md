Application to allow users to create and contribute to crowd sourced Experiments. 
The following four types of experiments can be created and contributed to:

* Counts - How many occurances of something did you see?
* Binomial - Success/Failure trials, such as a coin flip.
* Non Negative Integer Counts - Each trial results in a non negative integer
* Measurement - Repeated measurements where decimal values can be recorded.
